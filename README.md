Application Name: Dawa Time 


Brief Description: The Smart Medication Reminder App (Dawa Time) is designed to solve the problem of patients forgetting to take their prescribed medications on time. The app provides intelligent reminders, allows users to quickly confirm medication intake (Taken/Skipped), and sends alerts to caregivers if multiple doses are missed.
